# LeeroysPwnShop
This is project was part of the CodeClan programming course. In week 5, we were doing Ruby project week,
which was 6 days of coding plus 1 day of presentations in front of the class. This is a work in progress.

We were able to choose from 4 different projects and modify those as long as the general structure wouldn't be
changed too much.

## Programming & Web Fundamentals

Over the next week you have the chance to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

- Ruby fundamentals
- TDD (where appropriate)
- OOP
- Web Programming ( REST/MVC )
- Databases with CRUD actions

### Keith's Record Store

The owner of Keith's Record Store wants an app which will help him keep on top of his store inventory. He does not want an app that customers will see, but he will use to check stock levels and see what he needs to order soon.

You should be able to add stock, which would have an Artist and Album as well as the quantity available.

**MVP:**

- Create albums with the quantity that are in stock
- Create artists
- Show an inventory page listing albums and artists
- Show a stock level for the inventory items e.g. High/Medium/Low

**Possible Extensions:**

- Add a buy and sell price to each stock item
- Calculate the possible markup on items and show on inventory page
- Add a genre to an Album
- Any other ideas you might come up with

I took the Record Store and turned it into an RPG weapons shop for orcs, goblins and their ilk.

## Project Rules

You are required to submit your link to github as soon as it has been created.
The project must be built using only:

  - Sinatra
  - PostGRES SQL
  - HTML / CSS
  - Ruby

It must NOT use:

- Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
  - JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it
  - Authentication

We want to see lots of meaningful Git commits and the use of TDD where / if appropriate.
